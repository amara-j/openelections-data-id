The strategy will be to split the data frame at the columns so that offices
(e.g., president, senator) are grouped together. Each set of columns will be 
cleaned separately then assembled back together into one data frame. 

```{r}
# Clean the president data 
pres <- orig %>% 
  select(1:9) %>% 
  gather(candidate, votes, -Counties) %>%
  mutate(office = "President", district = "") %>% 
  select(county = Counties, office, district, candidate, votes)

View(pres)
```

```{r}
# Clean the senator data 
senator <- orig %>% 
  select(1, c(10:12)) %>% 
  gather(candidate, votes, -Counties) %>%
  mutate(office = "U.S. Senate", district = "") %>% 
  select(county = Counties, office, district, candidate, votes)

View(senator)
```

```{r}
# Clean the district 1 representative data 
rep1 <- orig %>% 
  select(1, c(13:15)) %>% 
  gather(candidate, votes, -Counties) %>%
  mutate(office = "U.S. House", district = as.character(1)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(votes)) %>%
  select(county = Counties, office, district, candidate, votes)

View(rep1)
```

```{r}
# Clean the district 2 representative data 
rep2 <- orig %>% 
  select(1, c(16:18)) %>% 
  gather(candidate, votes, -Counties) %>%
  mutate(office = "U.S. House", district = as.character(2)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(votes)) %>%
  select(county = Counties, office, district, candidate, votes)

View(rep2)
```

```{r}
# Combine all data sets
all_dfs <- bind_rows(pres, senator, rep1, rep2)

# Add the party column and write
all_dfs <- left_join(all_dfs, parties, by = c("candidate" = "candidate")) %>% 
  select(county, office, district, party, candidate, votes) %>%
  write.csv("output/20161108__id__general__county.csv", row.names = F)
